## 🌟 Why YouLy+?

Streaming services offer great libraries, but their web interfaces so trash, with this extension, it replace streaming shitty lyrics player to Apple Music-like lyrics

* **YouTube Music:** Transforms the default static or plain text lyrics into a rich, timed, karaoke-style experience.
* **Tidal Web (Experimental):** While Tidal Web offers synced lyrics, they are limited to **line-by-line** synchronization. YouLy+ make them to **word-by-word**.
* **Apple Music Web (Experimental):** The native web player attempts word-by-word sync, but the implementation is flawed:
    * **Precision Issues:** Native AM Web uses `setTimeout` and their musickit uses timeupdate which is inaccurate, causing lyrics became offsync and hard to read.
    * **Performance Hog:** Heavy JavaScript-based animations spike CPU usage, causing lag on single-threaded or older devices.
    * **Broken Layout:** Frequent visual bugs occur with pronunciation guides and word breaks on syllable-synced song lmao.
    * **Inferior Animation:** The web animations feels so broken, idk how to tell it, but it's a pain.

**YouLy+ trying to replaces these broken implementations with a lightweight, precise (idts), and visually faithful rendering engine.**

    -   *Tidal:* Upgrades line-sync to word-sync.
    -   *Apple Music:* Replaces the buggy native engine with a high-performance alternative.

-   **Instant Translation:** Translate lyrics on the fly using **Google Translate** or the powerful **Gemini AI** (API Key required).
-   **Romanization:** See lyrics written in the familiar English alphabet, even for languages that use different writing systems (like Japanese, Korean, or Russian).

## ⚡ Performance Reference

The benchmark machine used to develop this project is older hardware (AMD FX-6300 + GT 620 from ~2012). YouLy+ is optimized to run where native web players fail.

**GPU Performance (Targeting 60 FPS):**
* **768p (1366x768):** Stable 60 FPS on **NVIDIA GT 620** (1GB) or equivalent integrated graphics.
* **1080p (1920x1080):** GTX 650 / GT 1030 or above recommended for a locked 60 FPS.
    * *Note: Legacy cards (GT 620) can still achieve 45-60 FPS at 1080p with minor jitter.*
